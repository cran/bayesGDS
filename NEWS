NEWS file for bayesGDS package

VERSION 0.6.0 (December 13, 2013) [first entry in NEWS file]

   o  This is a complete reworking of the package, with new function names
      and arguments. The function for the rejection sampling phase is now
      sample.GDS. Function arguments have changed.  Altogether, the
      sample.GDS phase should run much more efficiently than previous versions.  

   o  The dependency to Rmfpr has been removed.

   o  An updated version of Braun and Damien (2013) is available in the /doc
      folder of the package.
