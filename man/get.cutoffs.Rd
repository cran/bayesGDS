\title{Draw thresholds for the accept-reject stage of the BD
sampling algorithm.}
\usage{
get.cutoffs(log.phi, n.draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{log.phi}{Vector of log.phi from the proposal draws.  All must
be non-positive.}

\item{n.draws}{an integer.  number of draws to be taken from the
target posterior.}
}
\value{
a numeric vector for v = -log.u (the thresholds for the
accept-reject stage).
}
\description{
Returns a vector of log(u), where u is the threshold
to determine if a proposal draw should be accepted as a draw from
the target posterior distribution.
}
\details{
For use in conjunction with the Braun and Damien (2012)
Generalized Direct Sampling algorithm.  This is usually not called
directly (and, thus, it is not exported), since it is called from
the sample.GDS function.
